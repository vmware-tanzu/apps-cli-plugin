## Overview

This Tanzu CLI plugin provides the ability to create, view, update, and delete application workloads on any Kubernetes cluster that has the Tanzu Application Platform components installed.

### <a id='About'></a>About Workloads

A Workload enables developers to choose application specifications such as the location of their repository, environment variables, and service claims.

Tanzu Application Platform can support range of possible workloads including, a serverless process that spins up on demand, a constellation of microservices that work together as a logical application, or a small hello-world test app.

## Documentation

The [documentation](docs) provides a usage guide, information about working with workloads, and the full command reference.
