# Development

This doc explains how to set up a development environment so you can get started
[contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to `tanzu apps plugin`. Also
take a look at:

- [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites)
- [Building](#building)
- [How to add and run tests](#testing)
- [Iterating](#iterating)
- [Uninstall](#uninstalling)

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions below to set up your development environment. Once you
meet these requirements, you can make changes and
[deploy your own version of apps plugin](#starting-apps-plugin)!

Before submitting a PR, see also [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Install requirements

You must install these tools:

- [`go`](https://golang.org/doc/install): for compiling the plugin as well as other dependencies - 1.19+
- [`tanzu CLI`](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework/blob/main/docs/cli/getting-started.md#install-the-latest-release-of-tanzu-cli): for adding the plugin
- [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/): for source control

### Setup your development environment
To check out this repository:

1. Create your own
   [fork of this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
1. Clone it on your machine:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/apps-cli-plugin.git
cd apps-cli-plugin
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/apps-cli-plugin.git
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```

_Adding the `upstream` remote sets you up nicely for regularly
[syncing your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)._

Once you reach this point you are ready to do a full build and install as
described below.

## Building
Once you've [setup your development environment](#prerequisites), let's build
`apps plugin`. [go mod](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#quick-start) is used and
required for dependencies.

**Install builder plugin**

Install the tanzu builder and test plugins. Set variable `OS` to `linux`, `darwin` or `windows` depending on your OS:

```sh
TANZU_VERSION=$(cat TANZU_VERSION)
TANZU_HOME=$HOME/tanzu
curl -Lo admin-plugins.tar.gz https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework/releases/download/${TANZU_VERSION}/tanzu-framework-plugins-admin-${OS}-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf admin-plugins.tar.gz -C ${TANZU_HOME}
tanzu plugin install builder --local ${TANZU_HOME}/admin-plugins
tanzu plugin install test --local ${TANZU_HOME}/admin-plugins
```

**Building apps plugin**

To build and install the apps plugin, run: (repeat this step any time you pull new source code to get the latest)

```sh
make patch
make install
```
Note : For machines with arm64 processor run `make install GOHOSTARCH=amd64`

Verify installed plugins

```
tanzu plugin list
```

## Testing
### Unit testing

All unit tests can be run on any machine with go 1.17+ installed.

```sh
make test
```

### Acceptance testing
In order to use the CLI, the runtime dependencies need to be installed on the target Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
BUNDLE=${REGISTRY_URL/REPO:tag}
make integration-test
```

Note: `BUNDLE` env var is used by e2e tests to push source code bundle. This image is not deleted after the test.

### Add test

Any contribtuions for bug fix or feature requests will require unit and integration tests as part of the PR.

### Cluster requirement
- Create a Kubernetes cluster
- Deploy [Cartographer](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer#installation)

## Iterating
As you make changes to the code-base, there are several special cases to be aware
of:

- **If you change/add Cartographer APIs**, then you must run
  `make prepare` to update generated code. You might also require creating fakes via [dies](https://pkg.go.dev/dies.dev/diegen) for easier testing.

- **If you change/add dependencies** (including adding an external dependency),
  then you must run `make prepare` command. In some cases, if newer dependencies are required, you need to run "go get" manually.

- **If you change/add any help text for flags on any command**, then you must run `make docs` command. This will generate command documentation. CI will fail if this content is not kept up to date.

- **If you change/add code completion**, then follow the steps to ease testing of this feature. Add the prefix `__complete` to your command e.g.

  ```sh
  tanzu __complete apps workload tail spring-petclinic --component=
  ```
  
  This will output the completion suggestions and the ShellCompDirective
  Add logs using `cobra.CompDebugln(msg string, printToStdErr bool)` and set `BASH_COMP_DEBUG_FILE` env variable to a local file path to see logs without adding new entries to the suggestions. Make sure to remove any logs before sending a PR

Once the codegen, dependency is correct, reinstalling the
plugin is simply:

```shell
make install
```

Or you can [uninstall](./DEVELOPMENT.md#Uninstalling) and
[completely redeploy `apps plugin`](./DEVELOPMENT.md#starting-apps-plugin).

## Uninstalling
You can delete apps plugin with:

```sh
tanzu plugin delete apps
```
